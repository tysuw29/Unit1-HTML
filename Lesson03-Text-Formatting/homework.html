    <h2>Welcome to my page</h2>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <b>Ty Suwanprutsachati</b>, not short for Tyler. Funnily enough, I'm also <i>Thai</i>, that's not how my name was thought of though. I just started my <strong>first year</strong> of high school. So, that means my grade level is <i>9th grade!</i> The school that I am attending high school in is called <b>Bergen Tech!</b></p><hr>
    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>Favorite? Well, that's not that hard for me personally. I <em><strong>ABSOLUTELY LOVE</strong></em> <b> anime!</b> I've been watching anime actively since <i>4th grade</i>, which is when I watched my first one! Not counting those ones no one counts though like Pokemon lol. I have watched over <strong>600</strong> different animes! I have also read around <em>300</em> different mangas! I track all my stuff read and watched on a website, and you wanna guess what my time spent watching anime and reading manga is since the website tracks time spent as well? <strong><em>5000 hours.</em></strong> Or if you don't understand how much that is, <b>200 days.</b> So yeah... I certainly do love that hobby, never plan on stopping.</p>
    <h3>Other things I like</h3>
    <p>It's not like that's my <i>only</i> hobby though, just my most dominant... by an <strong>insanely massive</strong> amount. I do draw daily, my daily drawing streak is <b>252</b> as of 9/9/25! I also like reading, if it wasn't obvious from the manga numbers. I've been reading books <i>way before</i> I started mangas and animes. I am an avid video game player as well, I have <b>600</b> hours on the strategy game Battle Cats. I have hundreds on VSRG games as a whole. Around <b>900</b> hours on the rhythm game Geometry Dash. As well as way way more games that I have hundreds of hours on. I don't play those popular games like shooters or whatever though, I love <b>bullet hells, rhythm games, tower defense games, and story based games</b>. I also have a <strong><em>ton</em></strong> of other hobbies that I spent tons of time on, but this is getting really long, so I'll cut it here. I'm very much an all rounder lol.</p>
